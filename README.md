# Forecasting-Energy-Consumption

The objective is to forecast energy consumption from the following data:
* Historical building consumption data
* Historical weather data and weather forecast for one or a few places geographically close to the building
* Calendar information, identifying working and off days
* Meta-data about the building, e.g., whether it is an office space, a restaurant, etc.
